Installation
=====================================================================

Requires pyOpenSSl:
To install pyopenssl for the unifiedinstaller version, download the pyopenssl source, 
cd to the source directory and run setup.py using the bundled python:

/opt/Plone-3.0.6/Python-2.4.4/bin/python setup.py install 

=====================================================================
How to install
=====================================================================
Untar the file into your products directory and edit the WiKIDAuthPlugin.py file 
to reflect your WiKID setup:

    domaincode = '127000000001'
    host = '127.0.0.1'
    port = 8388
    caCert = '/opt/Plone-3.0.6/zinstance/Products/WiKIDAuthPlugin/WiKID-ca.pem'
    pkey = '/opt/Plone-3.0.6/zinstance/Products/WiKIDAuthPlugin/plone.p12'
    passPhrase = 'passphrase'

Restart Zope

In the ZMI, click on acl_users, select WiKIDAuthPlugin from the drop-down list
and click Add.

Click on WiKIDAuthPlugin and Check the box for Authentication to activate 
the Plugin.

=====================================================================
Debugging
=====================================================================

PAS can be difficult to debug as "PAS eats exceptions".  

You can check the logs on WiKIDAdmin to see of the request is getting 
to the server.

First, you will see the one-time passcode request:
"Issued passcode to device 5665045168396496484"

Then you should see the successful validation from Plone:

"Verified credentials - UserID: nowen Domain: 010100000010"

Installing the WiKID Server  
=====================================================================

Versions are available here:

=====================================================================
Mutual HTTPS Authentication
=====================================================================
The WiKID PC tokens support mutual https authentication, thwarting network-based
Man-in-the-middle attacks.  Simply Add the https URL of your Plone site to
the domain as the "Registered URL". 

WiKID uses a hash of the server certificate stored on the authentication server 
to perform site authentication. When the user requests an OTP, the hash is also 
sent to the token client. Before presenting the user with the OTP, the token 
client fetches the certificate from the website, hashes it and compares it to 
the retrieved hash. If the hashes match, the URL is presented as validated and 
the default browser is launched to that URL. This method leverages the security 
and investment in SSL certificates and provides a consistent session and mutual 
authentication method to the user.
